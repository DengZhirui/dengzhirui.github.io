Previously, I got my bachelor's degree in Renmin University of China major in Computer Science. Currently, I am a Ph.D student from Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, major in artificial intelligence. 

My name is Zhirui Deng. I am a 3rd year Ph.D student major in artificial intelligence from Renmin University of China in China and I am now applying for a visiting Ph.D financed by China Scholarship Council(CSC). I want to inquire an oppotunity to do research with you under your supervision. 

I am really interested in your researches, especially in diversified recommendation. The paper "Improving End-to-End Sequential Recommendations with Intent-aware Diversification" did inspire me a lot. My research interests focus on information retrieval and recommender system. Specifically, I am particularly interested in improving the diversity of information systems. I am currently working on search result diversification and diversified recommendation. I have already published and submitted several papers on WSDM, TOIS, TKDE, and IRJ. The paper named "CL4DIV: A Contrastive Learning Framework for Search Result Diversification" accepted by WSDM 2024 tackles the problem of rough document initial representation and devises a contrastive learning framework for search result diversification. Recently, I am investigating leverging the relationship between different users to improve the diversity of recommender system. My research interests are highly linked with the research areas of your Lab, and I sincerely wish to continue my studies there. 

During my visiting period, I plan to continuing to investigate the general learning principles of diversified information systems including the diversity of text and multimodal diversity. If possible,I hope to have further discussion with you about the research plan. I apply for a one-year visiting Ph.D student position. After one-year study, I will come back to Renmin University of China to accomplish my doctor degree. One thing should be mentioned is that the China Scholarship Council(CSC) will provide financial support for my research, which include both the daily expenses and the transportation cost.

The rest of my qulifications and experience are outlined in the accompaying CV. Sincerely thank you for sparing time to read my letter. I am looking forward to your reply. 



Specifically, I want to investigate the general learning principles of biological brains. I am particularly interested in developing a computtional framework that reveals a simplified (maybe oversimplified) model of how (a part of) our great brains work. This involves comprehension on three levels: network architecture (microcircuits, connection rules), modeling of various types of neurons, and modeling of synaptic dynamics. 

Spiking neural networks are what drew me to this highly attrective field. Currently, I am developing a bio-plausible idea that differs from backpropagation and provides local learning signals to synapses during continuous training without distinct forward/reverse phases. Plasticity arises from the mismatch between the signals received by the apical dendrites of principal cells and their somatic firing activity. The resulting network may adhere to the cortex's mini-columns architecture and automatically abstract knowledge from inputs via unsupervised reasoning. 
I began following Prof. xxx's work in 2022, including A, B and other recently published C. My research interests are highly linked with the research areas of the Lab, and I sincerely wish to continue my studies there.
