My name is Zhirui Deng. Previously, I got B.S. in Renmin University of China major in Computer Science. Currently, I am a PhD student from Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, major in Artificial Intelligence. My research interests focus on information retrieval and recommend system. I am currently working on search result diversification and diversified recommendation. 

Specifically, I want to investigate the general learning principles of biological brains. I am particularly interested in developing a computtional framework that reveals a simplified (maybe oversimplified) model of how (a part of) our great brains work. This involves comprehension on three levels: network architecture (microcircuits, connection rules), modeling of various types of neurons, and modeling of synaptic dynamics. 

Spiking neural networks are what drew me to this highly attrective field. Currently, I am developing a bio-plausible idea that differs from backpropagation and provides local learning signals to synapses during continuous training without distinct forward/reverse phases. Plasticity arises from the mismatch between the signals received by the apical dendrites of principal cells and their somatic firing activity. The resulting network may adhere to the cortex's mini-columns architecture and automatically abstract knowledge from inputs via unsupervised reasoning. 
I began following Prof. xxx's work in 2022, including A, B and other recently published C. My research interests are highly linked with the research areas of the Lab, and I sincerely wish to continue my studies there.
